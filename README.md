# KYC Hyperledger Fabric üîê

Welcome to the KYC Hyperledger Fabric repository! This project is designed to demonstrate the use of Hyperledger Fabric for building a secure, decentralized Know Your Customer (KYC) system, ensuring data integrity and privacy across financial institutions.

üöÄ **Project Overview**

With increasing concerns about security and privacy in the financial sector, KYC Hyperledger Fabric aims to provide a blockchain-based solution that allows institutions to securely share customer identity information while maintaining data integrity, transparency, and compliance with KYC regulations.

This project showcases how Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain, can be used to decentralize and streamline the KYC process, making it more efficient and reliable for financial institutions and their customers.

üåü **Features**

‚Ä¢	Decentralized Identity Verification: Securely share KYC data across institutions without a central authority.
‚Ä¢	Data Privacy & Security: Hyperledger Fabric ensures that only authorized entities have access to sensitive customer data.
‚Ä¢	Immutable Audit Trails: Every action is logged immutably, providing a clear and auditable trail of identity verifications.
‚Ä¢	Scalability & Flexibility: Built on the modular architecture of Hyperledger Fabric, the system is scalable and adaptable to various KYC needs.
‚Ä¢	Permissioned Blockchain: Restrict access to authorized participants, ensuring a trusted and private environment.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

‚Ä¢	**Hyperledger Fabric**: Permissioned blockchain for securing and sharing KYC data.
‚Ä¢	**Docker**: For setting up and managing the Hyperledger Fabric network.
‚Ä¢	**Node.js**: Server-side programming and API interaction with the blockchain.
‚Ä¢	**Chaincode**: Smart contract implementation in Hyperledger Fabric.

üßë‚Äçüíª **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

‚Ä¢	Docker
‚Ä¢	Node.js
‚Ä¢	Hyperledger Fabric

** Installation **

1.	Clone the Repository
 
```
 git clone https://github.com/peii14/kyc-hyperledger-fabric.git
```
2.  Start the Hyperledger Fabric Network
Navigate to the project directory and bring up the Hyperledger Fabric network using Docker.

```
cd kyc-hyperledger-fabric
./startFabric.sh
```
3. Deploy Chaincode
Install and instantiate the smart contract (chaincode) that governs the KYC transactions.
```
./deployChaincode.sh
```

4. Run the Node.js Server
Start the API server that interacts with the blockchain.
```
npm install
npm start
```

5. **Access the KYC Dashboard**

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the KYC system.

  

**üìö Documentation**

  

For detailed documentation on how this system works, visit the [Hyperledger Fabric documentation](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/) or check out the project‚Äôs source code for more details.

  

**Architecture**

  

The system architecture consists of:

  

‚Ä¢ **Peer Nodes**: Where smart contracts are executed.

‚Ä¢ **Orderer Nodes**: Ensure transactions are consistently added to the ledger.

‚Ä¢ **Channel**: Private blockchain networks where KYC data is exchanged securely.

‚Ä¢ **Chaincode**: Smart contracts that handle the business logic for KYC operations.
